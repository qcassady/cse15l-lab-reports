Keys pressed: ```<ctrl-v><emter>```  
I had the login command copy-pasted, so I ran the command before typing in my password and pressing enter again, which logged me into my ieng6 account.

Keys pressed: ```<ctrl-c><ctrl-v><enter>```  
I went to the lab description on the class website, and copy pasted the ```git clone``` command before running it. This cloned the lab files into my ieng6 account.

Keys pressed: ```<l><s><enter><c><d><space><l><a><b><7><enter><b><a><s><h><space><t><e><s><t><.><s><h><enter>```  
I checked which files I had, then changed my directory to that of the lab. Once there, I ran the ```test.sh``` file to see how many tests failed.

I ran the ```vim``` command on the ```ListExamples.java``` so that I could edit it. I then moved my cursor to the location of the error, then pressed `a` to append the code to be correct. After fixing the code, I saved my code and exited the `vim` editor.

Keys pressed: ```<b><a><s><h><space><t><e><s><t><.><s><h><enter>```  
I ran the tests again, and my changes fixed the code to get them to run.

I wrote out and ran the command to commit my changes to the repository, adding the message `"fixed tests"`.
