Keys pressed: ```<ctrl-v><enter>```  
I had the login command copied to my clipboard, so I used ctrl-v to paste the command into the terminal and ran the command using enter before typing in my password and pressing enter again, which logged me into my ieng6 account.

Keys pressed: ```<ctrl-c><ctrl-v><enter>```  
I went to the lab description on the class website, copied the ```git clone``` command using `ctrl-c`, before pasting it with `crrtl-v` and running it with `enter`. This cloned the lab files into my ieng6 account.

Keys pressed: ```<l><s><enter><c><d><space><l><a><b><7><enter><b><a><s><h><space><t><e><s><t><.><s><h><enter>```  
I checked which files I had by typing `ls` and pressing enter to run it, then changed my directory to that of the lab by typing `cd` and the directory that I wanted to go to before pressing enter. Once there, I ran the ```test.sh``` file by typing `bash test.sh` and pressing enter to see how many of the tests failed.

Keys pressed: ```<v><i><m><space><L><i><s><t><E><x><a><m><p><l><e><s><.><j><a><v><a><enter><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><down><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><a><backspace><2><esc><:><w><q><enter>```  
I ran the ```vim``` command on the ```ListExamples.java``` file so that I could edit it by typing `vim ListExamples.java` and pressing enter. I then moved my cursor to the location of the error by pressing the down arrow key and the right arrow key a bunch of times, then pressed `a` to append the code to be correct by changing the 1 to 2. After fixing the code, I saved my code with `:wq` and exited the `vim` editor.

Keys pressed: ```<b><a><s><h><space><t><e><s><t><.><s><h><enter>```  
I ran the tests again by typing `bash test.sh` and pressing enter, and my changes fixed the code to get them to run.

Keys pressed: ```<g><i><t><space><c><o><m><m><i><t><space><L><i><s><t><E><x><a><m><p><l><e><s><.><j><a><v><a><space><-><m><space><"><f><i><x><e><d><space><t><e><s><t><s><"><enter>```  
I wrote out and ran the command to commit my changes to the repository by typing out `git commit ListExamples.java -m "fixed tests"` and pressing enter, which saves it to my github with the commit message `"fixed tests"`.
