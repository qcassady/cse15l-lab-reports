First I started off with just adding Hello, which calls my handlerequest method. The input to this is a URI and is what determines what is added to the string output or whether a 404 error is called. Before calling the method, the result string is empty. After calling the method, the word "Hello" gets added to the result string. The handleRequest is being fed the URI of "localhost:4000/add-messsage?s=Hello".

Next I replaced Hello with Howdy for my URI.
