# Lab 5  
## Original Post  
I am using my personal laptop, running Windows 10, and using VisualStudioCode to do my programming.  
My `grade.sh` file is supposed to `echo` "Full Score!" when you pass all the tests, but instead of doing so it says "1/1" instead. The x/1 is meant to be reserved for the repositories that fail one or more tests, but I can't seem to figure out what to change to get this to work properly.  
It runs fine with any of the repositories that fail a test, such as `https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3` where it says `0/1` like it should, but for a correct repository such as `https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected` it will say `1/1` instead of `Full Score!`.
